# Flask App with CLIP Integration

This Flask web application allows users to draw an image based on a given prompt and then compares the similarity between the drawn image and the prompt using the OpenAI CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model.

## Features

- **Paint Page**: Users can draw an image based on a provided prompt.
- **Prompt Generator**: Users can receive a random prompt to inspire their drawing.
- **Similarity Comparison**: The drawn image is compared with the provided prompt using CLIP, and the similarity percentage is displayed.
